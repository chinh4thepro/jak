So... uhh... I'm kinda addicted at making random keyboards... now I just need to figure out what this one should be. All I know that it would be in one whole board, contain most of the keys, have the standard staggered layout, and maybe be extensible. Heck. I don't even know what type of switches I want yet. Cherry MX, Kalih Choc, Topre (maybe?). So to start I just started messing around in Keyboard Layout Editor to figure out an overall layout. Fortunately, I was able to find a layout that I was happy with.

Now I need to figure out the hardware that I want to use. I'm thinking of something like a nrf52840 or maybe a rp2040 with a wireless module. Likely using MX keyswitches.
